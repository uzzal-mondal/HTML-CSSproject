					<h2> Page Title </h2>
					<p> or a few days each May, Google opens up and gives us all a glimpse into what it's working on in every aspect of the company at Google I/O. 2019's edition runs May 7-9, and this year is shaping up to be another big show. I/O always walks an interesting balance between being ostensibly focused on giving developers time to work and learn how to make their products and services interface with Google's, and Google itself making big consumer-ready announcements about new or improved products and services of its own.</p>

					<p>I/O '19 is expected to be no different, with a schedule that shows us the potential for big product announcements on the docket backed up by a couple of days worth of developer sessions to help those smart folks make the most of everything Google has made.

					Here's everything big and important we're expecting to see at Google I/O 2019.

					Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL</p>

					<p>Google I/O isn't typically big on hardware announcements, but I/O '19 is expected to have a relatively important one: the Pixel 3a and 3a XL will finally be announced. The new cheaper Pixel 3 variants are expected to hover in the $500-600 price range, making small cutbacks in the hardware and specs but retaining the exact same camera as the higher-end Pixel 3, which could be a huge deal for this price segment.
